Project Note: The Alchemy of Pixels and Play
see the demo here:- https://my-portfolio-alpha-self-81.vercel.app/
I built this 3D portfolio not just to showcase work, but to weave a digital spellâ€”one where code dances with art, and the browser becomes a portal. Hereâ€™s the secret sauce:

âš¡ Next.js: The Invisible Architect
The skeleton of this project, Next.js, isnâ€™t just a frameworkâ€”itâ€™s a time traveler. It pre-renders pages like a fortune teller, predicting what users need before they even click. SSR? More like Sorcerously Smooth Rendering.

ðŸŽª GSAP: The Puppet Master
GSAP doesnâ€™t animate elementsâ€”it orchestrates drama. Scroll-triggered reveals? Thatâ€™s the chorus. Hover effects? Solo performances. Every transition is a carefully timed breath, turning static pixels into a living, breathing narrative.

ðŸ‘¾ React-Three-Fibre: The Portal to 3D
Those Geometries aren't just a 3d figureâ€”itâ€™s a possession. React-Three-Fibre let me bind it to the DOM like a digital exorcism. Shadows, reflections, and rotations arenâ€™t math hereâ€”theyâ€™re incantations.

ðŸ“œ Prismic: The Shape-Shifting Scroll
Prismic isnâ€™t a CMSâ€”itâ€™s a mirror dimension. Clients (or future me) can tweak text, swap images, or rearrange sections without ever touching code. Itâ€™s content witchcraft, plain and simple.

Why This Stack?
Next.js + React-Three-Fibre: Because 3D shouldnâ€™t mean sacrificing SEO or speed.

GSAP: Because users deserve butter-smooth storytelling, not jarring jumps.

Prismic: Because even wizards need an easy way to update their spellbooks.
